Hatching Twitter has been one of the best books I have ever read. Due to its relatable nature to me with modern-day social media, computers, programming, drama, slang, and more, it is a book that has been fun to read and has provided a new perspective on something that surrounds us daily. It shows that there is a dark side to every company's rise to the top and that business is a ruthless environment. Alongside that, this book proves that there is a lot of adversity in success and that cash and work progress are king. I found this book relatively easy to read due to the linear plot and the easy-to-understand structure of sentences. There is no complex vocabulary to understand due to the already convoluted nature of the situations in the story.
